- 👋 Hi, I’m @tkinney74
- I am an accomplished recruiting and data professional who is continuing to find ways to grow!  I have spent nearly my entire career in technical recruiting.  I have achieved a lot, learned a lot, but needed something more. So, I threw myself into Data Analytics, something I am absolutely in love with. I have been a leader in both enterprise and start-up environments while always remaining hands on.  I am also a former athlete and passionate about charities.  Currently involved with Operation Smile (https://www.operationsmile.org/) and Meals on Wheels of Lancaster (Home - Meals on Wheels of Lancaster).  I hang with my family, love to golf, and enjoy life.

- 👀 I’m interested in growing businesses and working with data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, R, and any other Analytics tools/software
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Initiatives, People, and money.
